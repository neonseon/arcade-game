## Instructions

### Player

The player can go anywhere on the board. If there is a collision with a bug, the player is returned to its starting point.

### Obstacles

At any given time, no more than four bugs are on the board traveling at different set speeds and set positions that are determined randomly. The speed, positions, and number of bugs can be increased in `app.js`.

### Restart Button

Once the player reaches the water, the screen goes dim and a restart button allows the player to reset at the starting position.
